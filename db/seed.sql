(4,'I''m thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my summer internship at Synchrony as a Machine Learning Intern!

During my time at this innovative fintech company, I had the incredible opportunity to network with other interns, diving deep into cutting-edge technologies like PySpark, Hive, and cloud infrastructure. My work focused on optimizing complex machine-learning models, which was both challenging and rewarding.

A highlight of my internship was emerging as one of the top 3 finalists in the Best Business Innovation category across the entire UIUC research park. This recognition came as a result of my contributions to migrating our technology space from SAS to Python‚Äîa project that I''m immensely proud of.

None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support of my colleagues at Synchrony. I''m especially grateful to my assignment leader, Lian Wang and my mentor, Joe Lotti for their guidance. A special shoutout to Karin Dor Markovich for her continued support throughout my journey and making it an equally enjoyable experience.

I''m also excited to share that I''ll be continuing with Synchrony as a Co-op Intern this fall. I‚Äôm looking forward to even more learning and new experiences ahead!'),

'I''m thrilled to share that I''ve completed my MSc in Astrophysics from Cardiff University (awaiting thesis results). My MSc thesis, titled "Evolution of Binary Black Hole in the Presence of a Supermassive Black Hole", explores the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems and how supermassive black holes influence binary black hole mergers.

Prior to this, I earned my B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering from Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences. My B.Tech thesis focused on "CFD and Thermal Analysis of the Orion Re-entry Capsule," where I used Ansys Fluent and Ansys Steady State Thermal to analyze flow patterns and thermal effects during the spacecraft''s re-entry into Earth''s atmosphere.

I''m currently pursuing a nine-month advanced certification in Space Technologies with IISc, covering topics such as Space Biotechnology, AI for Space Robotics, Space-Based Navigation Systems, and Thermal Management Systems.

My hands-on experience includes:

1. Spartificial (2024): Classifying gravity glitches using deep learning techniques.
2. Rescape Aerospace (2023): Part of the re-entry team designing reusable satellites for aerodynamically effective re-entry.
3. Stellarion (2021-2022): Contributed to literature on solar energy stations in space and worked on a camera cover project with the Moon Village Association.
4. Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA, 2022): Attended a summer school led by esteemed professors.
5. HyperGalactic Ventures (2021-2022): Completed a research fellowship focusing on space-related projects.

With a deep interest in black hole mergers, triple systems, N-body simulations, I‚Äôm now looking to pursue a PhD and contribute to cutting-edge research.
If anyone has advice, tips, or guidance on PhD applications (particularly in black hole physics, gravitational waves, or related fields), or knows of opportunities in this area, I''d greatly appreciate your input!
Thank you in advance for your support and insights!'
